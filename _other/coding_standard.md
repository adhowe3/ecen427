## Grading Source Code 
The TAs will apply the following method  when evaluating your source code. The goal is to get you in the habit of writing, readable, reusable, high-quality code. As such the TAs will be quite strict when grading your code.
  * In general, the coding standard counts toward 30% of your lab grade (some labs don't apply).
  * Each lab has a set number of maximum points that represents how many infractions can be made before you earn 0% on the coding standard portion.
  * You will lose a point for each infraction, not just each type of infraction; however, the maximum number of points you can lose for each type of infraction is 5.  For example, if your code has 8 magic numbers, you will lose 5 points. 
  * For example, in Lab 2, if you lose 5 points, you will receive a coding standard score of 5/10, and thus 15%/30% on the coding standard portion of the lab.
 

| Lab  |  Points | Notes on Lab |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Lab2 |  10 | 30% of lab grade |
| Lab3 |  30 | 30% of lab grade |
| Lab4 |  15 | 30% of lab grade |
| Lab6 |  10 | 30% of lab grade |
