## Overview
One of the most important skills you can develop as an engineer is the ability to learn new things on your own.  No matter how much you already know, there will always be new technologies, tools, and techniques that you will need to learn as you progress in your career, and as technology continues to evolve.
This lab will give you practice in this area.  

## Implementation
* Identify a technical topic that you would like to learn more about that relates in some way to this class.  
* Spend at least two hours researching this topic.  Some ideas for resources:
    * Online tutorials & blogs
    * Youtube videos
    * Textbooks
    * ChatGPT
* Write a short report on what you learned.  While you can use AI tools to help you learn the concepts, this short report should be written in your own words.  The report should have the following headings.

        Topic: 
        How it relates to the class (1 sentence):
        Resources used (list of websites, videos, etc):
        Summary of what you learned (200-250 words):

The "Summary of what you learned", should not be a summary of the technology you studied, but rather should describe what you learned about it, what stood out to you, how it connects to other things you know, what you found interesting or surprising, what you might want to learn more about in the future, etc.  Or in other words, it should be personalized to your learning experience, and not just a summary of the technology itself.

## Submission
Add a file called *lab8.pdf* to your repository (in the root directory) that contains your report.  Tag your submission using the usual [submission instructions]({% link _other/submission.md %}).
