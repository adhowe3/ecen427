Now that you can SSH into your PYNQ board, you have access to a Linux system to complete a few tutorials required for Lab 1. 

## Linux Tutorial 

Carefully read through and practice the examples found in this [Linux tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/), including Sections 1-12. You are responsible to completely understand and know all material in the tutorial except for these limitations:
  * sed: you can ignore anything about sed.
  * You can use the Regular Expression Overview Section as a cheat sheet. You can reference this during the quiz on Learning Suite.

## Git and Github

If you aren't familiar with Git and Github, there are many online tutorials that can help you.  Now would be a good time to review them.  

These two cover Git and Github and are quite good:
  * [Learn Git in 15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE)
  * [Learn Github in 20 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhNq2kIvi9s)

This one is good as well:
