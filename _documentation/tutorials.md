Now that you can SSH into your PYNQ board, you have access to a Linux system to complete a few tutorials required for Lab 1. 

## Linux Tutorial 

Work through Modules 1, 2, 3 (skip the printing commands), and 4 of the [Linux Survival tutorial](http://linuxsurvival.com/). It has a simulated Linux terminal for practicing what you learn in the modules.

For a brief list of commonly used commands, see the [Linux Command Summary](https://byu-cpe.github.io/ecen224/resources#linux_commands_summary/).


## Git and Github

If you aren't familiar with Git and Github, there are many online tutorials that can help you.  Now would be a good time to review them.  

These two cover Git and Github and are quite good:
  * [Learn Git in 15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE)
  * [Learn Github in 20 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhNq2kIvi9s)

This one is good as well:
