Much of the work done in this class will be done using the command-line.  At minimum, you need a computer with a Unix-based command-line terminal.  

## Mac or Linux
If you are using Mac or Linux, you can use the built in terminal.  

## Windows
Follow [Microsoft's instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

You may want to use the new [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-US&gl=US) application as your default terminal.

## Testing SSH Capabilities 

Make sure you can run SSH by connecting to the CAEDM ssh server:

    ssh your_caedm_username@ssh.et.byu.edu
